    <h3>Paris</h3>
    <p>Paris is unlike any other location on Earth,<b> its beauty is unparalleled, the number of famous structures is incredible</b>, and its allure attracts a large number of people each year. It seemed impossible that such simple structures could have so much charm. <b>The Eiffel Tower is the most significant reason why I like Paris</b>.</p>
